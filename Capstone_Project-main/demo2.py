When you feel stressed, try the 4-7-8 breathing technique. It can help calm your nervous system. Here's how:
1. Breathe in quietly through your nose for 4 seconds.
2. Hold your breath for a count of 7 seconds.
3. Exhale completely through your mouth, making a whoosh sound for 8 seconds.
Repeat this cycle three to four times.

[ANXIETY_TIP]
For feelings of anxiety, try grounding yourself with the 5-4-3-2-1 method. It brings you back to the present moment. Acknowledge:
- 5 things you can see around you.
- 4 things you can touch.
- 3 things you can hear.
- 2 things you can smell.
- 1 thing you can taste.

[LOW_MOOD_TIP]
When your mood is low, sometimes a small change of scenery can help. Consider stepping outside for just five minutes of fresh air, or putting on a favorite upbeat song. It's not a cure, but it can be a gentle step in a positive direction.
